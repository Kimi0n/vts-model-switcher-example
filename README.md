# VTube Studio Simple Model Switcher Example
A simple VTube Studio example plugin that enables the switching of VTS models outside of VTS. This project is intended for new VTS developers to get started. It is designed to be very easy to understand and work without any external dependencies. 

Uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.

## Usage
1. Download and extract the project
2. Open VTube Studio and start the plugin API
3. Open the index.html in a browser
4. The plugin will connect automatically to port 8001, just accept the plugin in the VTube Studio window. The browser should now show "Status: Connected!". 
5. Click refresh to see the available models and switch them from there

## Additional info
You need to refresh after every model switch to see which model is currently active as it's not done automatically.

If the plugin doesn't connect, try to connect manually with the "connect" button.
