A simple VTube Studio example plugin that enables the switching of VTS model outside of VTS. This project is intended for new VTS developers to get started. It is designed to be very easy to understand and work without any external dependencies. Only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

3. Open the index.html in a browser
4. The plugin will connect automatically to port 8001, just accept the plugin in the VTube Studio window
The browser should now show "Status: Connected!". The plugin is now connected. If that's not the case; You can try to connect manually with the "connect" button.

5. Click refresh to see the available models and switch them from there
